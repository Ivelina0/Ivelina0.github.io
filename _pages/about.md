<!-- Intro paragraph -->
Hi you! I’m **Ivelina**, but most people call me **Eve**.  
I’m a final-year PhD student at **QMUL**, researching deep learning for **high-dimensional option pricing**
(not just Black–Scholes all day, promise!).

<!-- Research interests -->
### What I have specialised in so far is:
- **Probability & stochastic processes** (I do prefer the heavenly world of simulated data over messy real-world datasets. But we live in a non-simulation. Or do we?);
- **Stochastic volatility**: Heston & Wishart models;
- **Monte Carlo, Fourier pricing, and PDE methods**;
- **Neural approaches**: PINNs, DeepONets, operator learning.

<!-- Non-Research but still technical interests -->
### Beyond the PhD
I also answer random behavioural and economics questions through data-science projects  
(Python / SQL / HPC) and write about them on my blog.

Sometimes I write **sci-fi stories**, and I might post those too. Who knows.
