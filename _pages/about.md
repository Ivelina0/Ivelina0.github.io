Hi you! I’m **Ivelina**, but most people call me **Eve**.  

I’m a final-year PhD student at **QMUL**, researching deep learning methods for computing arbitrage-free option prices. In particular, my work focuses on numerically approximating high-dimensional PDEs and Fourier-based pricing operators using neural networks. (not just Black–Scholes all day, promise!).

---

### What I have specialised in so far is:
- **Probability & Stochastic Processes**. I prefer the heavenly world of simulated data over messy real-world datasets. But we live in a non-simulation. Or do we?
- **Stochastic Volatility**: Heston & Wishart models
- **Monte Carlo, Fourier pricing, and PDE methods**
- **Neural approaches**: [PINNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999118307125), [DGM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06000), [DeepONets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193). Basically anything that [Steve Brunton](https://youtu.be/JoFW2uSd3Uo?si=zGf7Pws30vOg64rf) has posted about.

### Beyond the PhD
I also like to answer random behavioural and economics questions through data-science projects and write about them on my blog.

Sometimes I write **sci-fi stories**, and I might post those too. Who knows.

#### Books, learning, and hobbies.
Beyond the realm of Mathematics textbooks, I like to read non-fiction, econ, politics and behavioural science books. I also love philosophy, sci-fi and classic novels but time seems to be such a scarce resource these days... 

**My current top 5 favourites:**
- [**Against the Gods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128429.Against_the_Gods): The Remarkable Story of Risk by Peter L. Bernstein
- [**Thinking, Fast and Slow**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=s4YJFNSE1v&rank=1) by Daniel Kahneman
- [**Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48930266-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=NHBaFWZy7U&rank=1) by Lisa Feldman Barrett
- [**The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6046141-the-mis-behaviour-of-markets?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_29) by (the legend) Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson
- [**Notes from Underground**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=cAbCQNjj2v&rank=2) by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

I also quite enjoy the contrast between the dark, existential focus of Russian classic literature and the class-conscious, conversational tone of English classics. Reading literature feels like immersing myself in the history, culture, and emotional world of the people of that time — something you can never fully find in history books.

#### Sports

I’m a lifelong learner, and that curiosity extends well beyond academics. I genuinely love picking up new sports and physical skills!

My personal rule is to take on a new sport every one to two years and stick with it long enough to become “not too bad” at it. For me, that means learning the fundamentals properly and building consistency, until my brain doesn't overthink every move my body has to make. 

While curiosity is what draws me to new sports, many of these pursuits have been competitive rather than purely recreational. I’ve competed for multiple **volleyball** teams, **rowed** for QMUL — including racing at HORR 2024 (not WeHORR, but HORR), **ran a marathon** in 2025, won first place in regional **high jump** and a **gymnastics** competition in Bulgaria before moving to the UK, and performed as part of a **dance** crew at the Paralympic Games through a youth centre I attended growing up.

These experiences have shaped how I approach sport (and life): with commitment, discipline, and a genuine enjoyment of long-term progression.

More recently, I’ve been tackling **yoga** and it has quickly become one of my favourite things to do in between work breaks.
