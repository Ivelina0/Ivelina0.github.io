Hi you! I’m **Ivelina**, but most people call me **Eve**.  

I’m a final-year PhD student at **QMUL**, researching deep learning methods for computing arbitrage-free option prices. In particular, my work focuses on numerically approximating high-dimensional PDEs and Fourier-based pricing operators using neural networks. (not just Black–Scholes all day, promise!).


### What I have specialised in so far is:
- **Probability & Stochastic Processes** (I do prefer the heavenly world of simulated data over messy real-world datasets. But we live in a non-simulation. Or do we?);
- **Stochastic Volatility**: Heston & Wishart models;
- **Monte Carlo, Fourier pricing, and PDE methods**;
- **Neural approaches**: PINNs, DeepONets, operator learning.


### Beyond the PhD
I also like to answer random behavioural and economics questions through data-science projects and write about them on my blog.

Sometimes I write **sci-fi stories**, and I might post those too. Who knows.

### Books, learning, and hobbies
- Against the Gods
- Thinking, Fast and Slow
- Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain
- The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets
- Notes from Underground
