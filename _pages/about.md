        <p class="mb-3">
          Hi you! I’m Ivelina, but most people call me Eve. I’m a final-year PhD student at QMUL researching deep learning
          for high-dimensional option pricing (not just Black–Scholes all day, promise!).
        </p>

        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>I like Probability & Stochastic Processes. I prefer the heavenly world of simulated data over messy real-world datasets.</li>
          <li>I love learning about maths through its history: what problems people were trying to solve, and how ideas evolved.</li>
          <li>My PhD combines stochastic volatility (Heston/Wishart), Monte Carlo, Fourier pricing, PDEs, and neural nets (PINNs/DeepONets).</li>
          <li>I also answer random behavioural/econ questions with data science projects (Python/SQL/HPC) and write about it on my blog.</li>
          <li>Sometimes I write sci-fi stories, and I might also post those too. Who knows.</li>
